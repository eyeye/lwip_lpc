 *
 * This is a template implementation of the "__write" function used by
 * the standard library.  Replace it with a system-specific
 * implementation.
 *
 * The "__write" function should output "size" number of bytes from
 * "buffer" in some application-specific way.  It should return the
 * number of characters written, or _LLIO_ERROR on failure.
 *
 * If "buffer" is zero then __write should perform flushing of
 * internal buffers, if any.  In this case "handle" can be -1 to
 * indicate that all handles should be flushed.
 *
 * The template implementation below assumes that the application
 * provides the function "MyLowLevelPutchar".  It should return the
 * character written, or -1 on failure.
